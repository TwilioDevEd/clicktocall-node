## Set up

### Requirements

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) v10 or v12

### Twilio Account Settings

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your own application.
Before we begin, we need to collect all the config values we need to run the application:

| Config Value | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID  | Your primary Twilio account identifier - find this [in the Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/project/settings).                                                         |
| TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN   | Used to authenticate - just like the above, you'll find this [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/project/settings).                                                         |
| TWILIO_NUMBER | A Twilio phone number in [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) - you can [get one here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) |

### Local Development

1. First clone this repository and `cd` into it.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/clicktocall-node.git
   cd clicktocall-node
   ```

2. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy the sample configuration file and edit it to match your configuration.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    See [Twilio Account Settings](#twilio-account-settings) to locate the necessary environment variables.

4. Launch local development web server, will run on port 3000.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. For Twilio to be able to talk to your application, you'll need a way to make your server publicly available to the internet. For local testing purposes, we recommend using [ngrok](http://ngrok.io/). Ngrok provides secure introspectable tunnels to localhost webhook development: for more information and instructions on setting up ngrok to work with your application, check out [this section of the Click to Call tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/tutorials/click-to-call-node-express#testing-your-app-locally).

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

6. Finally, open up your browser and go to your ngrok URL. It will look something like this: `http://<sub-domain>.ngrok.io`

That's it!

### Tests

To execute tests, run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
npm test
```

### Cloud deployment

Additionally to trying out this application locally, you can deploy it to a variety of host services. Here is a small selection of them.

Please be aware that some of these might charge you for the usage or might make the source code for this application visible to the public. When in doubt research the respective hosting service first.

| Service                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) | [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)                                                                                                                                       |
